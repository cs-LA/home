# KTrunk Privacy Policy

KTrunk is privacy focused. KTrunk does not collect any usage data or analytics information. 
None of your data in KTrunk ever leaves your devices, unless you turn on iCloud Sync, or export the data.

KTrunk can use iCloud to securely back up its notes, and make them available on all your devices. 
iCloud encrypts your data in transit and at rest on Appleâ€™s servers. 
Using iCloud with KTrunk is entirely optional, and by default it is turned off.

If you turn off iCloud Sync in the KTrunk app, all your notes will be removed from iCloud. 
Furthermore, I have no access to any of your data in the app or iCloud.

Any data you store in iCloud is subject to the [Apple Customer Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/).
