<span class="en">KTrunk can use iCloud to securely back up its notes, and make them available on all your devices. iCloud encrypts your data in transit and at rest on Appleâ€™s servers. 
Using iCloud with KTrunk is entirely optional, and by default it is turned off.</span>

<span class="en">If you turn off iCloud Sync in the KTrunk app, all your notes will be removed from iCloud. Furthermore, I have no access to any of your data in the app or iCloud.</span>

<span class="en">Any data you store in iCloud is subject to the [Apple Customer Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/).</span>
